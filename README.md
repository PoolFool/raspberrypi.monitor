# Monitor & Information Rest API for Raspberry PI

This is a very lean little project based on SpringBoot 2.0M7 and [Pi4J](http://pi4j.com). I'm planning to use this in a SmartThings SmartApp later so I can see my Pi's status in the SmartThings app. The idea came from [here](https://github.com/nicholaswilde/berryio-smartthings)
